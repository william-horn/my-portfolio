# Development

As mentioned above this is the initial release of this portfolio project (version 1.0.0.0). Being such, some experimental strategies were used during development. There are no known current bugs, but there is still improvement to be made such as:

- CSS Optimization
    * Some employments of accessing the HTML elements within the CSS may not be very optimal. For example, there are some properties being overwritten and reapplied later on.
    
* Code Clean-Up
    * Great efforts were made to write and maintain clean code, however it could be written with a bit more scalability in mind.

- Additional features
    * As great as the site is currently, there are tons more features to add for user experience and portfolio quality!

Stay tuned for more!
